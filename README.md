- Hi, Iâ€™m @tidewatercoder
- The languages I am interested in learning are python, c++, and java.
- Currently I am in a cybersecurity course that taught me python and one of the repository has a script that I coded for a homework assignment.
- I am hoping to become a python developer and learn a variety of languages.
